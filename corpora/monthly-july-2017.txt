Another global cyber attack is fitting end for first month of theshadowbrokers dump service. There is much theshadowbrokers can be saying about this but what is point and having not already being said? So to business! Time is still being left to make subscribe and getting June dump. Don’t be let company fall victim to next cyber attack, maybe losing big bonus or maybe price on stock options be going down after attack. June dump service is being great success for theshadowbrokers, many many subscribers, so in July theshadowbrokers is raising price.

TheShadowBrokers July dump is 200 ZEC or 1000 XMR. Using same addresses as June same instructions.

TheShadowBrokers is having special invitation message for “doctor” person theshadowbrokers is meeting on Twitter. “Doctor” person is writing ugly tweets to theshadowbrokers not unusual but “doctor” person is living in Hawaii and is sounding knowledgeable about theequationgroup. Then “doctor” person is deleting ugly tweets, maybe too much drinking and tweeting? Is very strange, so theshadowbrokers is doing some digging. TheShadowBrokers is thinking “doctor” person is former EquationGroup developer who built many tools and hacked organization in China. TheShadowBrokers is thinking “doctor” person is co-founder of new security company and is having much venture capital. TheShadowBrokers is hoping “doctor” person is deciding to subscribe to dump service in July. If theshadowbrokers is not seeing subscription payment with corporate email address of doctor@newsecuritycompany.com then theshadowbrokers might be taking tweets personally and dumping data of “doctor” persons hacks of China with real id and security company name. TheShadowBrokers is thinking this outcome may be having negative financial impact on new security companies international sales, so hoping “doctor” person and security company is making smart choice and subscribe. But is being “doctor” persons choice. Is not being smart choice to be making ugly tweets with enough personal information to DOX self AND being former equation group AND being co-founder of security company.

TheShadowBrokers is announcing VIP Service. What is VIP Service? For months many peoples is messaging theshadowbrokers...Do you have X or Y vulnerability? Will you hack X or Y for me? Do you have intel on X or Y organization? Do you have intel on my organization? Have I been hacked? In past theshadowbrokers is not taking request or providing individual services. This changes with VIP Service. For one time payment of 400 ZEC you getting theshadowbrokers VIP attention. VIP Service is no guarantee of future good or services, negotiation for those is being separate. Haters will be saying this is joke, not serious, who will be paying just to talk to theshadowbrokers? Some party is already paying where do you think theshadowbrokers is getting idea.

ZEC address for VIP Service, include email for contact in memo.

Last theshadowbrokers is including mystery gift. Mystery gift is mystery to theshadowbrokers as well. Some peoples is sending small payment with hidden service url. TheShadowBrokers is not visiting url so no idea what it is. Could be good. Could be bad. Could be nothing. TheShadowBrokers is having too many enemies with to many resources to be finding out. But be enjoying at own risk. Smelling hidden service FBI hackish.
